# React Store Capstone Project


It includes the following:

- Formik for form validation feedback
- React Bootstrap UI library
- React frontend to register, login, products & cart
- React Redux to handle state
- React Router Dom for site navigation
- Vite was used for the app's creation for performance reasons instead of Create React App
- Yup for form validation checks

## Original App Purpose

The App was created as part of an exercise for the bootcamp, HyperionDev and intended as a demo of my frontend skills for my portfolio.

Original goals can be found in "06-011-1 Capstone Project - React App.pdf" located in the folder "Hyperion Project Documentation"

It was to be React Redux based app that would allow users to add products to a cart like an online store as well as demo form validation for users logging in and registering.

The user is presented with a list of products that they can add to a cart which shows the total price. They can then select the shipping where all the selected products get purchased.
More info about the shipping can be found by clicking on the button "Shipping Info" which presents the info in some modals.
